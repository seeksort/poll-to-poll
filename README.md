# poll-to-poll

(Node.js, HTML/CSS) An app that allows authenticated users to create and delete polls. Results are displayed using Chart.js.

This is one of the [Free Code Camp Back End projects](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app). App title is a pun on the title of a really good [Michael Palin travel documentary series](http://palinstravels.co.uk/static-12).
